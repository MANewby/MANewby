 ## Hiya I'm Maize A. V. Newby

I have skills in both front end and back end development, and I love to come up with creative solutions to complex problems. I am passionate about learning new languages and creating web applications to solve real world problems that are accessible to end users with various needs. I build these solutions using the MERN stack.
